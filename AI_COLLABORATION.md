# AI Collaboration Process

## Overview

This project demonstrates effective collaboration between a human developer and AI assistant,
focusing on the processes and patterns that lead to successful software development.

## Key Patterns

### 1. Project Setup & Planning

- Initial project scope discussion
- Creating and maintaining design documentation
- Using AI to explore potential approaches

### 2. Iterative Development

- Starting with minimal implementations
- Testing and validating solutions
- Progressive enhancement of features
- Example: Evolution of the movement system

  ```javascript
  // Initial approach
  game.moveForward();

  // Evolved to
  game.moveEntity(entity, MovementType.MOVE_FORWARD);
  ```

### 3. Problem-Solving Flow

1. Present initial concept
2. AI suggests implementation
3. Human reviews and refines
4. Iterate on solutions
5. Document decisions

### 4. Code Quality Maintenance

- Regular refactoring discussions
- Architecture improvements
- Technical debt awareness
- Example: Separating renderer responsibilities

### 5. Effective Prompting Patterns

- Clear problem statements
- Specific requirements
- Contextual information
- Example corrections

```

This could serve as a template for discussing:
1. How to effectively collaborate with AI
2. Common pitfalls to avoid
3. Best practices for AI-assisted development
4. Real-world examples from this project
```
