# Planning Phase

## Initial Project Setup

- Choosing the right tools (Vite, vanilla JS)
- Setting clear boundaries for the POC
- Defining success criteria

## Architecture Planning

- Breaking down the problem (map, movement, rendering)
- Component identification
- Dependency management

## Working with AI During Planning

- Using AI for technical research
- Validating architectural decisions
- Exploring potential pitfalls

## The Human Architect's Role in Planning

### System Boundaries

- Defining clear component responsibilities
- Identifying potential extension points
- Planning for future capabilities

### Quality Gates

- Establishing coding standards
- Defining acceptance criteria
- Setting architectural guidelines

### AI Guidance

- Providing context for generated code
- Steering toward maintainable solutions
- Identifying areas requiring special attention

Example from our project:

```javascript
// Initial renderer concept
class Renderer {
    drawMap() { ... }
}

// Architect-guided evolution
class Renderer2D { ... }
class TopDownMapRenderer extends Renderer2D { ... }
// Future: ThreeJsRenderer extends Renderer2D
```

This evolution demonstrates how architectural foresight helps create more flexible, extensible systems.

## Collaborative Decision Making

### AI's Strengths

- Quick generation of implementation options
- Broad knowledge of patterns and practices
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Detailed documentation generation

### Human Architect's Strengths

- Domain expertise
- System-wide architectural vision
- Recognition of potential pitfalls
- Understanding of business context
- Experience with long-term maintenance

### Synergy in Action

Consider this exchange from our project:

```javascript
// Human: "We need to handle entity movement in our game..."
// AI: "Here's a simple implementation:"
game.moveForward();

// Human: "What if we need to move other entities later?"
// AI: "Good point! How about this more flexible approach:"
game.moveEntity(entity, MovementType.MOVE_FORWARD);

// Human: "Yes, and let's prepare for different movement rules..."
// AI: "We could add validation and movement strategies:"
class MovementStrategy {
    canMove(entity, direction, map) { ... }
    move(entity, direction) { ... }
}
```

This dialogue shows how:

1. AI provides quick, working solutions
2. Human architect identifies future needs
3. Together, we evolve the design
4. Each participant brings unique value

### Best Practices for Collaboration

- Clear communication of requirements
- Explicit sharing of architectural concerns
- Regular validation of generated code
- Documentation of key decisions
- Maintaining focus on long-term maintainability
