# Iterative Development

## The Build-Review-Refine Cycle

- Starting with minimal implementations
- Testing generated code
- Identifying improvements
- Example: Evolution of the MovementControls component

## Managing Technical Complexity

- Incremental feature addition
- Maintaining separation of concerns
- Example: Map representation vs rendering

## AI Collaboration Patterns

- Clear problem statements
- Contextual guidance
- Code review and refinement

## Human Focus: Managing the Iteration Cycle

- **Setting Iteration Boundaries**

  - Determining scope of each iteration
  - Identifying when to refactor vs when to continue
  - Recognizing emerging patterns

- **Code Review Responsibility**

  - Validating AI-generated solutions against architectural principles
  - Identifying repeated patterns that suggest needed abstractions
  - Example: Noticing similar movement patterns led to `moveEntity` abstraction

- **Technical Debt Assessment**
  - Maintaining a "debt journal"
  - Prioritizing refactoring opportunities
  - Balancing quick wins vs long-term maintainability
