# Problem-Solving Flow

## Step 1: Problem Definition

- Clear requirements
- Technical constraints
- Expected outcomes

## Step 2: Solution Exploration

- AI-suggested approaches
- Architectural considerations
- Trade-off discussions

## Step 3: Implementation & Validation

- Code generation
- Testing
- Refinement
- Example: Raycasting implementation

## Human Focus: Guiding Problem Resolution

- **Problem Definition Mastery**

  - Breaking complex problems into manageable pieces
  - Identifying dependencies and constraints
  - Setting clear success criteria

- **Solution Evaluation**

  - Assessing AI-proposed solutions against architectural principles
  - Identifying potential impact on other system components
  - Example: Evaluating renderer hierarchy for future view types

- **Implementation Strategy**
  - Deciding implementation order
  - Managing technical dependencies
  - Ensuring consistent patterns across solutions
